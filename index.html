              Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; 21 April 1926 – 8
              September 2022) was Queen of the United Kingdom and the other
              Commonwealth realms from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022.
              She was queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her life and
              served as monarch of 15 of them at the time of her death.[a] Her
              reign of 70 years and 214 days is the longest of any British
              monarch and the longest recorded of any female head of state in
              history.

              Elizabeth met her future husband, Prince Philip of Greece and
              Denmark, in 1934 and again in 1937.[42] They were second cousins
              once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark and third
              cousins through Queen Victoria.

                George VI's health declined during 1951, and Elizabeth then
                frequently stood in for him at public events. When she toured

                From Elizabeth's birth onwards, the British Empire continued its
                transformation into the Commonwealth of Nations.[77] By the time
                of her accession in 1952, her role as head of multiple
                independent states was already established.

              In the 1977, Elizabeth marked the Silver Jubilee of glorious her
